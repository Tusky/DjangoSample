# DjangoSample
This is a sample Django project which samples how I organize and code a website.

Each function and class code contained in the repository was coded by me.

It is created for Python 3.6.

Side notes:
 - The code is overcomplicated in a few places. The reasoning for that is to show some of the advanced topics, rather than do 3 generic views and publish.
 - Design template used can be found here: http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/blog-home/
 - Readability over simplicity and DRY.

Buzzwords used in the project:
- Model-View-Template (MVT)
- Class-based views (I know function-based also. But CBV are much fancier.)
- Admin actions
- Unit tests with 100% coverage (Even though I rather have functionality tested than getting 100% coverage)
- URL namespaces
- App-mentality
- Context processors
- DB Migration
- Bootstrap 3
- Documentation
- Class-based view
- ModelAdmin configurations
- Template inheritance
- Custom django options used (Example: humanize)
- CSRF Token usage
- Third party package usage (django-bootstrap4)
