# DjangoSample
This is a sample Django project which samples how I organize and code a website.

Each function and class code contained in the repository was coded by me.

It is created for Python 3.4.2 even though I usually work with 2.7.x

Sidenotes:
 - The code is overcomplicated in a few places. The reasoning for that is to show some of the advanced topics, rather than do 3 generic views and publish.
 - Design template used can be found here: http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/blog-home/
 - Readability over simplicity and DRY.
